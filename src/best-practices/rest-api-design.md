## Introduction

REST API Design is a key aspect of building a successful REST API. It is important to design your API in a way that is easy to understand and use. This guide will provide you with some best practices to follow when designing your REST API.

## Characteristics of an effective REST API
- Easy to use and work with
- Hard to misuse.
- Complete and concise.


## Naming Conventions
- Use nouns to represent resources. For example, `/users` instead of `/getUsers`.
- Use plural nouns to represent collections. For example, `/users` instead of `/user`.
- Leveraging logical grouping by resource hierarchy. This will reflect relationships between resources. For example, `/users/{userId}/orders` represents orders for a specific user. Which indicates that orders are a sub-resource of users.
- Collection are plural nouns. For example, `/users` is a collection of users. And resources are singular nouns. For example, `/users/{userId}` is a single user.
- Avoid complex URLs. Use simple and easy to understand URLs. Try not to go deeper than `/resource/{id}/subresource/{id}`.
- Use hyphens to improve readability. For example, `/inventory-management` instead of `/inventory_management`.
- Use lowercase letters in URLs. This is a common practice and makes URLs easier to read. For example, `/users` instead of `/Users`.
- Make sure to use versioning in your URLs. This will help you manage changes to your API over time. For example, `/v1/users` instead of `/users`.


## Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination
- Use one or more query parameters and pass key-value pairs to filter data. For example, `/users?role=admin` to filter users by role.
- We can extend the filtering to fetch specific fields. For example, `/users?fields=name,email` to fetch only the name and email fields.
- Use query parameters to sort data. For example, `/users?sort=+created_at,-name` to sort users by creation date in ascending order and name in descending order. The `+` and `-` signs indicate ascending and descending order respectively. 
- Use query parameters to paginate data. For example, `/users?page=2&limit=10` to fetch the second page of users with a limit of 10 users per page.

## Idompotency
- Make sure that your API is idempotent. This means that the same request can be made multiple times without changing the result. This is important for ensuring that your API is reliable and consistent.
- HTTP methods like GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent. POST is not idempotent.
- HTTP status code may differ, but the response should be the same. For example, if you delete a resource, when sending request for first time, it returns 204 (No Content) and for the second time, it returns 404 (Not Found). But the response should be the same, i.e., the resource is deleted.

## Asynchronous Operations
- Use asynchronous operations for long-running tasks. For example, if you have an API endpoint that performs a task that takes a long time to complete, you can return a 202 (Accepted) status code and provide a URL where the client can check the status of the task.
- When sending the 202 status code, you can include a `Location` header with the URL where the client can check the status of the task. For example, `Location: /tasks/{taskId}`.
- The client can then poll the URL to check the status of the task. Once the task is complete, the client can retrieve the result from URL provided in the response. For example, `/tasks/{taskId}/result` to get the result of the task.
- Make sure to include a `Retry-After` header with the estimated time when the task will be completed. This will help the client know when to check the status of the task again.

## Error Handling
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the result of the request. For example, use 200 (OK) for successful requests, 400 (Bad Request) for invalid requests, 404 (Not Found) for missing resources, and 500 (Internal Server Error) for server errors.
- Include a descriptive error message in the response body. This will help the client understand what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, `{ "error": "Resource not found" }`.
- Use standard error formats. For example, use the Problem Details for HTTP APIs format (RFC 7807) for error responses. This format includes fields like `type`, `title`, `status`, and `detail` to provide detailed information about the error.

## Security
- Use HTTPS to secure your API. This will encrypt the data transmitted between the client and the server and protect it from eavesdropping and tampering. Use tools like Let's Encrypt to get free SSL certificates for your API. You can do TLS termination at the load balancer or reverse proxy level.
- Use authentication to control access to your API. There are different authentication methods like API keys, OAuth, and JWT that you can use to authenticate clients. Choose the one that best fits your use case.
- Use authorization to control what actions users can perform on your API. For example, you can use 
ACLs (Access Control Lists) or RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to define permissions for different users or roles.
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API. You can limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period to prevent them from overwhelming your server. You can use tools like Redis or Nginx to implement rate limiting.
- Use input validation to prevent injection attacks. Validate input data to ensure that it is safe and does not contain malicious code. You can use tools like OWASP ESAPI to validate input data and sanitize it before processing it.

## Documentation
- Provide clear and concise documentation for your API. This will help developers understand how to use your API and integrate it into their applications. You can use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to generate API documentation automatically from your code.
